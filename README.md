# Josh's Profile Site

A personal resume site for Josh Brown.

## About

I really wanted to document the projects I have worked on and teams I have been fortunate to be a part of. I also thought creating this website would provide an opportunity to practice web design. One of my hobbies is photography, so I made it my goal to have all the photos be originals instead of using stock images. All the images for the projects on this page are clickable and will bring up a bigger version. The one on the left is the original code from this site controlling the contact form. It has since been changed.
 

## Installation

I have absolutely no clue why anyone would want to host their own version of my site but here is how to do it:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jbis9051/Josh-Brown-info
$ cd Josh-Brown-info
$ npm install
$ npm run pub
Published!
$ npm run start
```

Website will be on [http://localhost:6969](http://localhost:6969). Why `6969`? Because "sixty-nine" (not "four-twenty") is my favorite number.
